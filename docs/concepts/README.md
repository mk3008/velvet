# Transfer Concept Specs

This directory contains Concept Specs for `@ashiba-ts/transfer-dogfood`.

Concept Specs define stable meanings, responsibility boundaries, and invariants for concepts that span multiple features. They are not implementation plans, SQL, DDL, queryspecs, or test cases.

Structured Concept Specs live in each `<concept-id>/concept.json`.
Machine-readable concept lifecycle, glossary, and relationship metadata lives in `concept-relationship.json`.
Human review views such as Concept Maps or generated VitePress indexes should be regenerated or checked from that metadata; do not add concept graph facts only to a review view.

Run `pnpm docs:transfer` from the repository root to regenerate VitePress review views under `docs/generated/transfer/`.
Those Markdown pages are derived review views and are intentionally ignored by git.

Concept lifecycle:

- Defined concepts use `<concept-id>/concept.json`.
- Draft concepts use `<concept-id>/concept.json` with optional `DRAFT.md` notes.
- A draft is reviewable work in progress, not an authoritative Concept Spec.
- Promote a draft by updating lifecycle status in `concept.json`, then regenerating review views.

Available Concept Specs:

This list is a human entrypoint. Use `concept-relationship.json` and generated VitePress Concept views for completeness checks.
