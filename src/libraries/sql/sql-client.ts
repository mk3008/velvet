/**
 * Minimal SQL client contract shared by the app and adapter boundaries.
 *
 * - Production: adapt this contract to your preferred driver (node-postgres, mysql2, etc.) and normalize the results to `T[]`.
 * - SQL files remain canonical. Runtime code uses generated query snapshots and metadata.
 * - Tests: replace the implementation with a mock, a fixture helper, or an adapter that follows this contract.
 *
 * Connection strategy note:
 * - Prefer one live client per DB context or worker process for better performance.
 * - Multiple clients can coexist in the same workflow as long as each one owns its own lifecycle.
 * - Do not share a live client across parallel workers without proper synchronization.
